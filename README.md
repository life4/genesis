# Genesis

Generic functions for Go. Bringing the beauty of functional programming in Go 1.18+.

**Features:**

+ Over 130 generic functions for channels, maps, and slices.
+ Uses the power of Go 1.18+ generics.
+ No code generation.
+ No dependencies (except [is](https://github.com/matryer/is) for testing).
+ Pure Go.
+ Sync and async versions of all the main functions.
+ For slices and channels.

**When to use:**

+ In a big project. More the project grows, more you find yourself writing boring generic code like "Min". Break the cycle.
+ In a team project. Each line of code you write means higher maintenance cost that in turn means loosing time and money.
+ In a pet project. Leave the boring stuff to us, focus on the fun parts.
+ When readability matters. `slices.Shrink` is a function with a human-friendly name and documentation. `s[:len(s):len(s)]` is a jibberish and black magic. Prefer the former.
+ When you miss some conveniences that come in other languages out-of-the-box.
+ When you write a highly concurrent code and don't want to manually implement code for cancellation, results collection and ordering, worker groups, context, etc.

**What's inside**:

+ `Filter`, `Map`, and `Reduce` for data processing on steroids.
+ `FilterAsync`, `MapAsync`, and `ReduceAsync` for making your code fast and concurrent with a single line of code.
+ `Grow` and `Shrink` for reducing memory allocations.
+ `Permutations` and `Product` for simple iterations.
+ `Shuffle` and `Sort` for randomization.
+ `Any` and `All` for simple flow control.
+ `Range`, `Count`, and `Cycle` for generating sequences.

And much more.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/life4/genesis
```

## Examples

Find the minimal value in a slice of ints:

```go
lambdas.Must(slices.Min([]int{42, 7, 13})) == 7
```

Double values in a slice of ints:

```go
slices.Map([]int{4, 8, 15}, func(el int) int { return el * 2 })
```

Concurrently check status codes for multiple URLs:

```go
urls := []string{
 "https://go.dev/",
 "https://golang.org/",
 "https://google.com/",
}
codes := slices.MapAsync(
 urls, 0,
 func(url string) int {
  return lambdas.Must(http.Get(url)).StatusCode
 },
)
```

## Usage

Genesis contains the following packages:

+ [slices](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/life4/genesis/slices): generic functions for slices.
+ [maps](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/life4/genesis/maps): generic functions for maps.
+ [channels](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/life4/genesis/channels): generic function for channels.
+ [lambdas](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/life4/genesis/lambdas): helper generic functions to work with `slices.Map` and similar.
